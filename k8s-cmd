quick commands to edit PODs and Deployments
----------------------------------------------------------
Remember, you CANNOT edit specifications of an existing POD other than the below.

spec.containers[*].image
spec.initContainers[*].image
spec.activeDeadlineSeconds
spec.tolerations

For example you cannot edit the environment variables,
service accounts, 
resource limits (all of which we will discuss later) of a running pod. 
But if you really want to edit, you have 2 options:

kubectl edit pod <pod name> 

above command will open the pod specification in an vi editor, if properties you are trying to edit is not editable
it will deny while saving.

The second option is to extract the pod definition in YAML format to a file using the command:

kubectl get pod webapp -o yaml > my-new-pod.yaml -- edit the file and delete the existing pod and create new pod by using the defination-file.
kubectl create -f my-new-pod.yaml 

Delete POD
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>

Create new pod: 
kubectl create -f <pod-defination-file.yml>

addhoc command to create pod:
kubectl run <pod-name> --image=<img-name> --restart=Never

Edit the deployment:
kubectl edit deployment my-deployment
